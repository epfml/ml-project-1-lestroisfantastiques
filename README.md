## Projet01
Jules Pirot, Alexis Firome, Pauline Roche

The purpose of this project is to implement basic Machine learning models which include linear, ridge, and logistic
regression, and then use them to train and later predict whether an individual is prone to a heart attack or not, based on
physiological and physical characteristics. Since our input data has an abundance of missing values, outliers, and features with heavy-tailed distributions, data analysis and preprocessing play a crucial role in improving classification accuracies

### Install

This project requires *Python* with the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).


### Code

Our code is composed of different jupyter Notebook : 
The first part of our project is composed of overviewing and cleaning the data: you can see the steps in the Prepocessing notebook (NB : we could not manage to go any further in the implementations of our preprocessing).
Then, you see our functions that we compared in the file `implementations.py`.
You can try our code with`run.py`. 



### Report
A 4-page report explaining how the data was analyzed and processed.
